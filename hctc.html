                <p>Bilbo Baggins was the first Hobbit to come to acclaim in the world outside the Shire, for Hobbits hid from the Big Folk. Gandalf made Bilbo join a company of dwarves as their burgeler on a quest to recliam their home of Erebor, the Lonley Mountian. The Dwarves had been forced from Kazad-Dum by the Balrog Durins Bane, and then they where forced from the Grey Mountians by Dragons. Before at last they settled in Erebor, and had much wealth, before the last great Dragon Smaug came out of the North and sacked that city home. They wandered in the wilderness, before fighting the war of the dwarves and orcs in the Misty Mountains and settleing in the Blue Mountains, but they still desired to return to their old home, and now they had Mr. Baggins to help them.<br>
                They traveled across Eriador and through Rivendell before being captured by orcs in the Misty Mountains, and in their escape they lost Bilbo. Bilbo had to wander in the deeds under the mountain before coming across the one Ring and Gollum. Gollum then ended up showing Bilbo the way out of the Mountain acidentally while trying to get the Ring back, but it made Bilbo invisable. Bilbo escape and was reunited with the dwarves. The Gandalf left them to go fight the necromancer in the south and  the company passed through Mirkwood and after an encounter with Spiders were captured in the elven Kings halls.<br>
                The elves and dwarves did not have a good relationship, and had an old feud. Eventually Bilbo freed them and they came to the Mountain, and after Bilbo burgeled some things, Smaug left to destroy Lake Twon but was killed by Bard, heir to the Kingdom of Dale. Then the Dwarves had a dispute with the elves and men and a great battle seemed set to come between them, before a large army of orcs came from the Misty Mountains and the Battle of the Five Armies was fought, and good won, but Thorin died. Then Bilbo returned home. Here he would end up adopting Frodo as his heir.</p>

            <h3>The Coming of the Wizards</h3>
                <p>The Gods of Middle Earth sent the order of the Istari to aid the peoples of Middle Earth against Sauron. Greatest of these were Gandalf and Saruman. Saruman travled at first to the east before returning to the west and being Gifted Isengaurd. He became very wise in Ring Lore, and desired the one for Himself, which would be his downfall to evil. Gandalf was more good natured, and Cirdan gave Gandalf his Ring when he arrived in Middle Earth. Gandalf traveled far and wide aiding the Free peoples of Middle Earth, and he alone discovered Hobbits and became very interested in them.</p>

            <h3>The Knigdoms of Gondor and Arnor</h3>
                <p>Gondor and Arnor where sundered after the death of Isildur. First we go over Gondor. Gondor grew great during the third age, peaking under the Ship Kings. But as time went by the line of King's began to fail. This included many childless Kings. Gondor also had to deal with large amounts of invaisions from Easterlings and Haradrim. These constant attacks led to wondering about whether something else was behind them. Soon the King and his children where killed in the Great plauge, and again in a war when they were invaded from two sides. But they were saved by a great General, Earnil. He was crowned the new king, but his son disappeared after meeting a challange by the Witch King in Minas Morgol. And the Stewards took comand.<br>
                The Stewards dealt with more invaisons and asked for aid from the Northmen, and Eorl the Young came down and defeated his enemys, and they gave a large swath of land to him and his people, and this became Rohan. Soon Denethor came to power, and he was wont to give it up.<br>
                Arnor had collasped earlier. The Kingdom split into three and they fought each other, until one of these Kingdoms joined with a new evil. The Witch King made Angmar in the North and fought a war with Arnor and the Elves. While Arnor won most of there territory was depopulated. But there was a long peace as both sides had been weakend during the war.<br>
                Soon Angmar attacked again and the Arnor was destroyed and the people fled to Lindon with the Elves, but the King was stuck hiding in the frozen north, and when he got a ship to rescue him it sunk, and then Gondor came from the South and destroyed Angmar, but Arnor was to weak to contiue, and the people went to a life as Rangers in the wild, protecting the last free settelments in Eriador, and the Kings line still survied.</p>

            <h3>Beren and Luthian and the First Age men</h3>

                <p>In the first age Men and elves did not wed together, except in a few special cases, and that line would never fail while the world lasted. It starts with Beren. He fell in love with Luthien, daughter of Thingol King of Doriath, and Thingol did not approve of this relationship, and told Beren to win his daughters hand, he would have to take a Silmaril, a great jewel in which the fate of the world was wrought, from the crown of Morgoth who had stolen them.<br> 
                Then Beren traveled north to take the jewel and with him went Luthien who aided him as they took the jewel but as they tried to escape the great wolf Carcaroth bit it from Berens hand, which is how he got the nickname one handed. He then returned with Luthien to Doriath and Thingol gave Beren Luthiens hand. But Carcaroth came down from the North, and Thingol went to hunt it. Carcaroth would have killed him if it wasn't for Beren who sacrificed himself.<br>
                Then Luthien herself died and in the halls of the dead she was give the choice to go back to be an elf in the land of the gods, or to go back with beren and live a mortal life, and she choose that. Then in middle earth they had a child, Dior, who became king of Doriath after Thingols Death, and he had the child Elwing, who fled to the bay of Balar with the Silmaril after Doriath was destroyed.<br> 
                The other part of this line comes from Tuor, who came to Gondolin and was given the hand of the Kings duaghter Idrihil. Then Gondolin was destroyed and they escaped, and they had a child, Earendil, who weded Elwing, and they had twins in Elrond and Elros, but then the Third Kinslaying came when Earendil was sailing to the gods land and Elwing cast herself into the sea as the twins where kidnapped. Then came the war of Wrath, in which Morgoth was at last defeated. Elros and Elrond where given the same choice as Luthien, and Elros choose to be a man, and became the first King of Numenor. Then Elrond choose to be an elf and he becaem father of Arwen, who had the same choice herself to make.</p>
