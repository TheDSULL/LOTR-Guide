        <h1>Middle Earth History: The Rings of Power</h1>
               
        <div id="rop">
            <h3>Concerning the Forging of the Rings</h3> 
                <p>After the Defeat of Morgoth, the great enemy, at the end of the First age, his cheif lieutenant Sauron avoided capture and went into hiding. The Elves which choose to remain in Middle Earth Inhabited Lindon, and they were ruled by High King Gil Galad. The Elves without the threat of evil prospered and expanded. One new Realm was formed by Celebrimbor, a mighty smith and last of the line of Feanor, who forged the Silmarils. He desired to be closer to the Dwarves at Kazad-Dum, and so founded Eregion. Here the friendship grew between elves and dwavers as had never grown previously, and all prospered.<br> 
                Then came the Return of Sauron, who founded his own realm in the land of Mordor, but for now he remained hidden. At last he left the dark land, desiring to order all living things, and disguised himself as Annatar Lord of Gifts, and offered his services to the elves. Those in Lindon suspected, but in Eregion he was accepted and he taught to eager students.<br>
                Soon he began to instruct the elves in the forging of rings, and these became the lesser rings, and they were many. But then at last his teaching led to the creation of the Great rings, of which 16 were made, and Sauron had a hand in the making of all. Celeibrimbor forged in sercet three rings which Sauron would never touch. At last Sauron returned to Mordor and forged the One Ring, which was the greatest of the Rings and had the power to dominate all others, and into he placed a part of his soul, forever attaching himself to the Ring.<br>
                When he put the Ring on though, the elves noticed him and took them off immediately. Then Suaron marched out to war and so began the war of the Elves and Sauron. He sacked the capital of Eregion, which was Ost in Edhil, and got his hands on the 16, but Celeibrimbor would not reveal the three. The Three had been given to other elves who would hide them. Gil galad had Vilya, Cirdan the Shipwright held Narya, and Galhadrial held Nenya. They would hide these from Sauron forever. Celebrimbor was killed by sauron and his body used as a banner for his armies. Then the aid from Lindon led by Elrond arrived, though to late and they were pushed back and would have been defeated if it wasn't for the Dwarves of Kazad-Dum, who covered the elves escape. They were trapped in their mountian forever more as Sauron ravaged and deforested Eriador, beseiging Lindon.<br>
                Then at last came the men of Numenor from beyond the sea from their island, which was there reward for aiding the elves in the first age. They crushed Sauron and sent him back to Mordor. This was the foundation of Saurons hate for the Numenoreans and their Heirs. He then distributed the 16, 9 he gave to lords of men, and these he corrupted into the Nazgul, his deadliest servents. 7 he gave to the dwarves, but they resited the corruption, although their greed increased. The ring which was Given to the lord of kazad-Dum was from Celebrimbor.</p>

            <h3>Concering the Fall of Numenor and the war of the last alliance</h3>
                <p>After the end of the first age, the three house's of men who had fought with the elves against Morgoth where rewared with an island and given many gifts making them greater then other men. This island was Numenor, and here they built the mightiest Kingdom men ever saw. They sailed to middle earth and aided the elves in their war against Sauron. But with all these gifts they began to desire inmortality for there lifes where so good. They would gradually forsake the God's and elves.<br>
                Eventually a king Ar Pharazon the Golden fought Sauron after the Dark Lord proclaimed himself Lord of men. Pharazon then invaded Middle Earth with great force and even with the Ring, Saurons forces deserted him at the sight of this host. Then he took Sauron to Numenor as a prisoner. But Sauron was cunning and soon worked himself as the conselor to the King. Numenor fell into decay, with few still loyal to elves led by Elendil. Eventually Pharazon declared war on the Gods and invaded their country, but then the worldd was changed and the lands of the God's departed, except for the elves could still reach it, but no mortal could. Numenor was sunk into the Sea and Saurons body perished, and he needed the Ring now to still have full power.<br>

                Elendil and his sons escaped, founding Gondor and Arnor and building many things in Middle Earth. And Sauron desired to destroy then and launched an attack onto Gondor with all his force, but the Gonndorians where valient and held him back while the forces of Arnor united with Gil Galad and the Elves of Lindon, and with them also came many free peoples in a great War of the Last Alliance.<br>
                It was a long war, and many died, but at last Sauron came forth and fought Gil Galad and Elendil, in a close fight before killing both. Then came Isildur, the son of Elendil who cut the ring from Saurons hands, destroying him, and then claiming it as his own.</p>

            <h3>Concerning the Ring During the Third age</h3>
                <p>But while the Ring lived, Sauron could never be truly defeated, and for a time he fled to the east of the world. The Ring Isildur took as he went North to take the Crown of his fathers Kingdom in Arnor, but on the way he was ambushed near the Gladden Feilds and while he tried to escape, the Ring betrayed him and he died, and the Ring sunk into the Anduin and was lost. Here it sat for 2500 years while all the fate of the world went on until at last it was picked up by Deagal, one of the River folk, who were like hobbits. But then his freind Smeagol killed him and took the Ring for himself and was corrupted, and he was kicked out of his home and went underneath the Misty Mountains, where Bilbo Baggins took it after it had tried to escape Smeagol.</p>
