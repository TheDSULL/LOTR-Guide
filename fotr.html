                <p>This book accounts Frodos journey across the long leagues of Eriador to Rivendell, whilst being pursued by the Nazgul, or Ringwraith, the servants of the Dark Lord. It starts with Bilbo's Birthday Party, where he disappears and gives up the Ring with the help of Gandalf. Frodo inheriants the Ring and after 20 years learns the Dark secrets that lie within it thanks to Gandalfs research. For it was the One Ring forged by Sauron, with which he seeked to dominate the wills of all others. He had lost it in the War of the Last Alliance and now he seeks it, for he put a part of himself into the Ring and can no longer reach his full power without it. Frodo then prepares to leave in the quietest way possible and so he goes across country and with him is Samwise, his servent. At last Frodo sets out from the Shire with Sam, Merry, and Pippin. They go through the Old Forrest and are almost caught by Old Man Willow before being rescued by Tom Bombadil. He also saves them again on their journey through the Barrow downs when they are caught by a wight. Then in the village of Bree Frodo meets a Ranger, Strider, who is of the line of kings for the lost Kingdom of Arnor. He guides them across Eriador, but at the old watch tower of Weather top they are assiled by the Nazgul who have been hunting Frodo throughout his journey all the way since he left the Shire. There he is stabbed by one of their poisioned blades and begins slowly fading into the shadows as they make there last dash to Rivendell, and with the help of Glorfindel, an elf, they come at last to Rivendell, with the nazgul being washed away by the River.</p>

                <p>Frodo recovers in Rivendell and meets up with Bilbo for the first time since his disappearance. In Rivendell Frodo also reconnects with gandalf, who had been missing from his initial journey. In Rivendell a council of the wise is held, where they decide what shall be done with the Ring. The only place it can be destroyed is in the fires of Mt. Doom where it was forged. They decide that the Ring must be destoryed, and choose to make a small Fellowship to accompany the Ringbearer, whom will be Frodo. It will also include; Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn(Strider), Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli. They then travel south through Eriador, vast empty country now free of the Nazgul, but above the Birds and other beast watch them. At last they attempt to pass over Cahadras, but the mountain defeats them with snow and they choose to go under. For there were the mines of Moria, the abandoned home of the Dwarves, before they were chased out by Durins Bane. They travel through and come across the Chamber of Mazerabul, where Balin lays, and there they are trapped but escape and as they cross the bridge of Durin Gandalf fights Durins bane, a balrog, deamon of the ancient world. Gandalf defeats the balrog, but he himslef falls into the abbyss. They all then escape and come to the elven kingdom of Lorien, where they rest. galadrial test all of there minds and loyalties here, and warns Frodo of trechery. Before departing down the great river they are gifted things from Lord Celeborn and Galadrial. Gollum is also noticed to be following them but they can't catch him. At the falls of Rarous they rest, and choose there future course, but Frodo and Sam sneak off, since Frodo didn't want to put the rest of his friends through Mordor after Boromir tryed to take the Ring.</p>
